# Planning

## Initial Design
Our initial plan is to make a nuke shaped device that wil be launched and protect the ascent and decent of the rasberry pi.

# Onshape_Design
Our onshape design is somewhat different from our drawing design as we decided to make it more similar to a missle.
Here is a reference picture and the actual design of the missile that we are creating.

# ReDesign
We ended up changing our design to a drone.
