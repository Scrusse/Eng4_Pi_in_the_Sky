# Designing_and_Planning

## Initial Design
Our initial plan is to make a nuke shaped device that wil be launched and protect the ascent and decent of the rasberry pi. We also ended up making a onshape design so that we were able to compare it to all the components that we needed.
Initial design and reference picture:

## ReDesign
We ended up changing our design to a drone. As we are able to make our own circuitboard and we wold be able to cut down on weight. It would also cut down on materials used as there was an excess use of ABP.
Here is our reference for a drone next to our initial design for our drone:

## Materials
Some of the materials and supplies that we need are easy to ge as we have them here in the lab. The other supplies would need to be ordered. Here is a list of all of our supplies include: 4 dc coreless motors, circuitboard, accelerometer (MPU6050), battery pack, altimeter (MPL3115A2), GPS module, and 3d printed/lasercut supplies. We would need to buy 4 dc motors, a 1300 mAh battery, and a GPS module. As those are the only things that we dont have in the lab.
