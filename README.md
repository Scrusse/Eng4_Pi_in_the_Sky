# Designing

## Initial Design
Our initial plan is to make a nuke shaped device that wil be launched and protect the ascent and decent of the rasberry pi. We also ended up making a onshape design so that we were able to compare it to all the components that we needed.
Initial design and reference picture:

## ReDesign
We ended up changing our design to a drone. As we are able to make our own circuitboard and we wold be able to cut down on weight. It would also cut down on materials used as there was an excess use of ABP.
Here is our reference for a drone:
